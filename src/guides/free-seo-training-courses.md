## Google Analytics Academy Courses

The analytics courses from Google are completely free and will give you a great overview of how to use Analytics.

You'll even get a fancy certificate!

The modules I would recommend running through are as follows:

- Google Analytics for Beginners
- Advanced Google Analytics
- Introduction to Data Studio
- Google Tag Manager Fundamentals

Check out the [analytics course here](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/academy/).

### Google Analytics 4

You'll also want to get up to speed with Google Analytics 4. This course at Googles Skillshop and the three modules will do just that.

The modules are as follows:

- Measure Your Marketing with Google Analytics
- Go Further with Your Google Analytics Data
- Google Analytics Certification

Check out the [GA4 course here](https://skillshop.exceedlms.com/student/catalog/list?category_ids=6431-google-analytics-4).

### Google Ads Certifications

Google provide their own training aimed to give you a mastery of Google Ads.

The course teaches you about Search, Display, Video, Shopping Ads, Apps and Measurement.

You can skip the video and apps modules if you feel you won't get any value from them, the other modules cover the basics of everything you'll need.

### Facebook Blueprint Courses

These are great courses from Meta, they teach you everything you need to know about using Facebook and creating ads on their platform.

It's very different to Google because rather than targeting keywords, you'll need to have a very good understanding of the audience you want to target.

If you target the wrong audience your ads won't perform.
