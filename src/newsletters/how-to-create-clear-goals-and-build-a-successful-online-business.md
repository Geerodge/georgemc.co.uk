A lack of clarity will kill your business.

Without clear strategy and messaging it's like throwing darts blindfolded. You might get lucky, but if you're serious you'll want a plan.

Use your plan as a compass, it's something you can reference to make sure you're heading in the right direction.

So, how do you create a plan that will lead your business to success?

Here's 5 simple steps you can follow to get clear and start growing your businessâ€¦

&nbsp;
### 1. Think Big Picture

If you don't know where you're going, having a compass is pointless.

You need to know which direction you should be heading, North, South, East or West.

Only one will be the pathway to success. (I'm a bloody poet!)

To figure out which direction is right for you, create a business statement.

It should include two key points:

- Specific business objectives - S*ell 20 products*
- Have a deadline - E*very month*

Don't feel stuck to this, these can evolve as your business grows.

&nbsp;
### 2. Define Your Daily Goals

Creating a set of goals can be one of the most valuable exercises you'll ever do.

Because without clear goals, how do you know if you're winning?

When you feel like your winning, and heading for success, it create a beautiful feedback loop that will motivate and push you forward.

Even when things get difficult.

So, how do you define your own goals for success?

- Define three simple tasks, you can do everyday, that will move you forward.
- If you have a team, make sure these tasks can be done by everyone
- Use these tasks to measure daily success for you and your team

&nbsp;
### 3. Create a Business Tagline

A tagline for your brand is like a great headline.

It can make or break your business. Use it to peak curiosity and create interest.

Epic taglines comprise of 3 key traits:

- Customers problem
- Your solution
- The result

Repeat it everywhere - your website, emails and socials.

&nbsp;
### 4. Clarify Your Messaging

Your messaging is a key part of the plan.

Without clear messaging you'll confuse your customers, and they'll go elsewhere.

Just like with your tagline you need focus on your customers problems. Don't talk about the benefits of your product, talk about how you'll transform their lives.

Remember, people buy things to fulfil these 5 basic needs.

1. To feel happy
2. To feel connected
3. To evolve and learn
4. To feel safe
5. To save time and effort

Craft your messaging around them.

&nbsp;
### 5. Prioritise and Delegate

You can't do it all.

You have a limited amount of hours in the day. 

If you're spending half the day on repetitive tasks, think about hiring a virtual assistant.

Decide what you enjoy doing the most, and the tasks where you can provide the most value.

Delegate the rest.
